# Sitcom Laughtrack mute tool 
### or *a LSTM network for audio classification*

Jeff Green, 2018

### Summary

A tool to mute laugh tracks from an audio clip without operator intervention.  Implements a recurrent neural network (LSTM network) to classify audio.

Technically, this could be used as a generic two-class audio classifier, but the model is not validated against anything besides laugh audio classification.
