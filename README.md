# Sitcom Laughtrack mute tool 
### or *a LSTM network for audio classification*

Jeff Green, 2018

### Summary

A tool to mute laugh tracks from an audio clip without operator intervention.  Implements a recurrent neural network (LSTM network) to classify audio.

Technically, this could be used as a generic two-class audio classifier, but the model is not validated against anything besides laugh audio classification.

### Example Output

See https://youtu.be/DeTQBiKzmYc for a clip with the laugh track muted using this tool.

### Details

Load the Jupyter notebook for code and explanation.

### Requirements

Uses librosa, Keras, Tensorflow, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, and more.  See the Jupyter notebook for details.
